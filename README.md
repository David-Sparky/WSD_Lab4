README -- Lab 4

In this lab I created the JSON file to hold the playlist information. Since XML has a very similar format to JSON, it was easy to convert the two. I struggled with some of the array notation within the JSON file, since it has been a while, but after looking at some of the examples from IIT and some documentation, I was ready to go.

The JS file parses the JSON file using Jquery and AJAX. A for loop integrates through each object in the array and allows for easy parsing using the objet selector. Once an object is selected, it is pushed to the correct HTML element.

The HTML for this lab was also modified from the original to include the proper information and to accommodate the list structure used by the CSS file.
